## Starting point:

In drug design projects, series of molecules are often created with a common
common core structure. If the protein structure of the target is unknown, the
question structural overlap arises. The hypothesis of the same Orientation of
the core structure should be taken into account.

## Task:

The aim of the project is to develop a software tool for the fully automated
superposition of a set of molecules with a common core structure. The core
structure should be alternatively given or calculated, the superposition should
be carried out under the boundary condition that the core structure is structure
is positioned approximately the same, whereby the final orientation depends on
the orientation of the whole molecule. The score loss due to superposition of
the core structure should be determined. 

## Research Questions:
- How do you construct data sets to test the method? Are there already data sets in the literature?
- How does one achieve the transition from pair superposition to multiple superposition?
- How do we account for the conformational space of the molecules?
- How do we identify the common core?
- How do we achieve dynamic binding of the core at one site?
